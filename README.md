# MLOps Course Notes

Hey everyone ðŸ¤— welcome to this repository!! This repository hosts my own course notes for the available courses on MLOps available online. I will make a list of important courses available, will try to cover them one-by-one and parallelly document my learning in form of notes and codes which I will upload here. 

**Why am I doing this?**

1. Coming from a research and a traditional academic background, I realized majority of models and experimentations done is always behind the scenes, and are not deployable or put in production, which restricts the usage of model. Reading articles, tons of papers on a usecase is one thing and putting the same model to test on the forefront, so that users actually use it on their devices is another.
2. Came across this field last year and wanted to learn about it, this is being used in many industries and companies so it becomes very crucial to have knowledge about MLOps and skill-up and have proficiency in tools.
3. As I go on learning from these courses, I will also build up cool real-life projects keeping in mind about the scale and production level details, this practice will make my skills strong.
4. Finally, this might be the collection of course notes that I might use for reference in future, or someone else might as well. That is why I would like to take this self initiative to curate a roadmap, take some courses, make self-notes, codes and open up the repository for others who want to learn MLOps. Once I finish this, I will also open up discussions tab so that others can participate in a healthy discussion and clear doubts. Let's learn and grow together ðŸŒŸ

## Courses
As I learn and go through these courses, I will categorize them in terms of factors like target audience, cost, time dedication needed, key areas etc. These are some of the courses, that I am planning to take and read through them.
